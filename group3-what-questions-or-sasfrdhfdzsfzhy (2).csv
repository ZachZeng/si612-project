"The ""person"" idea seemed very ambitious for this class. I'm not familiar with the technology presented but it was definitely the most unique idea! I'd say not to do the shopping cart, even though it's a great idea, since other groups also had the same idea. I like the smart utensil idea as well, but since you're presenting to (mostly) americans, I'd just advise to use american food measurements like tablespoon, teaspoon, etc instead of grams.",pollev.com/stephaniebre950,Courtney Snede,2019-09-30 20:17:01
"I think fashionable technology has a lot of potential, I'd think about the customizable aspects of the bracelet and how you'd make it attractive for everybody, not just somebody who normally wear bracelets. The shopping cart idea seems interesting. I think the smart spoon might be a bit too narrow.",pollev.com/stephaniebre950,guest977,2019-09-30 20:16:56
Well thought out problem - breaking it into two main ideas (making the distance disappear) is a great approach. I am super intrigued by your audio ideas! This would be interesting to test - how do you find the balance between creepy and endearing? (I mean that in the best way possible). The idea of recording emotion could be done through sound as well -- emotion is easily detected via auditory qualities of a person's voice. I would lean towards the first idea of addressing long-distance relationships - this idea is different from anything else I've heard and I think it offers a fun  opportunity to explore.       ***I also like the idea of the smart spoon - this was one of the ideas that I came up with that got cut from my group's approach.,pollev.com/stephaniebre950,Brianna,2019-09-30 20:16:47
"Love the background info provided on the challenge they are trying to solve. The string idea was a little unclear, maybe add more written description about what is happening on the game.",pollev.com/stephaniebre950,muneeb,2019-09-30 20:16:44
I really like the Shopping solution and smart spoon idea.,pollev.com/stephaniebre950,Youngmin,2019-09-30 20:16:41
"Smart spoon: Lots of cooking and prep work happens without a spoon, it might not be convenient to have to require that utensil to be used.",pollev.com/stephaniebre950,Jackson H.,2019-09-30 20:16:34
I really like the sensor spoon!!,pollev.com/stephaniebre950,Min Jin,2019-09-30 20:16:25
The long-distance relationship is a very good and interesting topic to explore - I like the idea of bringing together in the same space - the bracelet and app seems like a reasonable approach that could facilitate micro-interactions through the day. How would you try to mitigate abuse of this type of device or curb unhealthy aspects of a relationship that might be exacerbated by it?,pollev.com/stephaniebre950,Drew,2019-09-30 20:15:16
"The binaural idea is really interesting, and I really like the shopping cart idea, very practical",pollev.com/stephaniebre950,Cameron,2019-09-30 20:15:09
"I think the mood idea would be cool, especially in bringing awareness to people about how they feel.",pollev.com/stephaniebre950,Annabelle,2019-09-30 20:15:04
I liked the first idea of long distance relationships.,pollev.com/stephaniebre950,Shriya,2019-09-30 20:14:54
The reduce distance idea is great but curious about how to detect mood?,pollev.com/stephaniebre950,Chen,2019-09-30 20:14:54
"The audio idea is really interesting. I do, however, think the idea should be more flushed out and would like to hear more about it.",pollev.com/stephaniebre950,Amanda,2019-09-30 20:14:04
"For long distance relationships, I believe there is also a pillow on the market that both partners use as well. I like the idea of using activity to bring couples closer. I also think the binaural idea is cool, very futuristic and interesting!",pollev.com/stephaniebre950,guest257,2019-09-30 20:13:25
The mood bracelet would be a much better option than the app solution because it gives a subtle and private feeling,pollev.com/stephaniebre950,Kaushal solanki,2019-09-30 20:13:11
"I like the mood ring, but it could get weird if you don't want to share your moods with your partner or if you accidentally swipe the ring against something.",pollev.com/stephaniebre950,Henny T,2019-09-30 20:13:08
