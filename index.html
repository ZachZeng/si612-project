	  	<h1>Problem statement</h1>
	  	<p>The main purpose of this project is to take advantage of ubiquitous computing to motivate people who wish to change their body shapes and work toward their fitness goals. Our audience will be people who want to live a healthy life by changing their body shapes. The challenges usually faced by this group of population is the lack of motivation to maintaining workout and diet habits. We would like to address this challenge by helping people maintaining motivated and being aware of if they are on the right track. We want to keep the environment of the product open for now. The scope of the activities we could augment includes people who want to record their physical body changes and compare their current status to their past data and ultimate goal.</p>

	  <div id="motivation" class="main-section">
	  	<h1>Motivation and Preliminary Observations</h1>
	  	<p>
	  	After defining the scope, we shifted the gear to get a basic understanding of how is this problem affect people and what are their main concerns. We were able to obtain many useful information by casually talking to people who hope to change their body shapes and observing posts on social media. Here are some findings we gather from preliminary observations.
	  	</p>
	  	<ol>
	  		<li>
	  			<h2>People easily lose motivation to continue and a lot give up eventually</h2>
	  			<p>
	  				Sticking to the fitness goal has never been easy for almost anyone. A study on Bodybuilding.com reveals that 73% of the American adults who set fitness goals as part of their New Year’s resolution eventually give up on it (Bodybuilding.com, 2019). We usually find ourselves having so many excuses such as schedule conflict, undesirable body and weather conditions for not working out or keeping diet on a certain day. From a behavioral economics perspective, when people are too prompted for the comfort they have in the short-term, such as the good taste of the creamy ice cream and juicy hamburger, and lacking a long term goal that keep them motivated, it is very easy for people to go with the short term benefits and forget about their long term goal.

	  		</li>

	  			<h2>People want more intuitive way to measure their changes and keep the record</h2>
	  			<p>
	  				The most commonly used way for measuring changes of body shapes is weighing scale. They have now evolved into something more intelligent and smarter (Figure 1). It can now be connected to mobile apps to keep track of your weights to help you better evaluate your health conditions. However, fitness coach, Steve Kamb, suggests that scale is not a desirable method for understanding the progress and knowing if you are on the right track. We also hear from individual who have workout habit saying that body shape may change without seeing the change of the weight. While the weighing scales is able to measure body fat, which is better, it is not intuitive for individuals to understand their progress.

	  		</li>
	  		<li>
	  			<h2>Many people like recording and sharing the progress of changing as method for motivating themselves</h2>
	  			<p>
	  				We found on social media such as Instagram that many people take pictures and make notes on a regular basis to record their changes in order to motivate themselves (Figure 2). The similar things are shown on TV series. For example, on the TV series ‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’, Midge has the daily habit to measure herself and make notes on her private notebook (Figure 3). People like to see that they are making progress, and it becomes one of the reasons that keep them motivated on workout and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. However, this method can be hard to persist as we talked before. What’s more, you can hardly compare your shapes across the timeline in a direct and intuitive way.

				</figure>
				<p>
					We also see that for those who keep the records on the process of changing, another reason for doing so it that they would like to share the pictures of body shapes and BMI data on social media for getting more attention and social recognition.
				</p>
	  		</li>
	  	</ol>
	  	<p>
	  		These preliminary findings regarding the lack of motivation, the difficulties stemmed from and unintuitive inconvenient method for seeing and tracking progress, and the  need for assurance on the effort inspire us to ideate on possible solutions to address these challenges. While we recognize that further studies on human behaviors and behavior change methods as well as user perceptions of publicizing their progress on social media are needed, we started brainstorming concepts to take our first step on building the minimum viable product.

	  <div id="ideation" class="main-section">
	  	<h1>Ideation Process</h1>
	  	<p>
	  		Based on our preliminary observations, our team conducted a brainstorm session where everyone in the team was given 20 minutes to write and sketch their ideas on the sticky notes. After this session, we went over the notes and sketches together, highlighted the recurring themes and features, and narrowed down the selected sketches to three main concepts.

	  <div id="concepts" class="main-section">
	  	<h1>Three Concepts</h1>
	  	<div id="concept1">
	  		<img src="images/concept1.jpg">
	  	</div>
	  	<div id="concept2">
	  		<h2>Concept 2: Smart Bed - Record Your Body Shape Silently</h2>
	  		<p>
	  			Our second concept is a smart bed that can capture your body shape and also gets the weight without your notice. 
				When people lie in the bed, the mattress will sag and outline the body shape of the user. The smart sensor will record that and send the data to the mobile app to reproduce the shape of the person in bed. Besides, the pressure sensor under the mattress will detect the weight of the user and also send the weight information to the mobile app. The app will store the data to the database for users to search for the body shape and weight data at a certain time spot.

	  	<div id="concept3">
	  		<h2>Concept 3: Mini Projector - Capture Body Shape on Any Vertical Space</h2>
	  		<p>
	  			We came out the concept 3 as a mini mobile project that could set up on any vertical space such as locker in the gym, any mirrors, and flat walls at home; and it could easily capture the real-time body shape of the users on any spaces. The projector is able to store the historical data and reflect the pictures of previous body shape as a personal preference. The function of storage could be linked to a designed app on the smartphone, for easier checking and sharing.
