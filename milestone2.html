	  	<p>
            Lack of motivation can be a primary reason to stop people from maintaining the workout and diet habits. Before and after body shape change seems to be a key stimulus to keep people motivated. Therefore, in Milestone 1, we decided to target people who want to maintain workout and diet habits by helping them motivated and be aware of if they are on the right track through tracking their body shape changes.
        </p>
        <p> 
            We came up with three concepts to help our target audiences to record their physical body changes and compare their current status to their past data and ultimate goal.

        <div>
            <h2>
                Research Questions
            </h2>
            <p>
                Coming from Milestone 1, our main concern toward this project is whether the design will provoke people’s body anxiety. To better understand people’s perceptions of body shape and determine the user group we could better target to, we want to explore the following research questions first:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    How do people in different cultures think of their body shapes?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What are the ideal body shapes in different cultures?
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Once we addressed the above concerns, we would like to ask the rest of the research questions:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    What is people’s goal through workout and diet habits?
                </li>
                <li>
                    How do people keep track of their workout and diet outcomes?
                </li>
                <li>
                    When and in what context would they think of their body shapes?
                </li>        
                <li>  
                    What behaviors and emotions result from the changes in body shape?                    
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>To answer our research questions, we used two different methods: cultural probe and Interview.</p>
    
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Cultural Probe</h2>
            <p>We designed a two-part cultural probe to better people’s perception of body shape in different cultures (research questions 1-2). </p>
            <h3>Part I</h3>
            <p>
                We recruited a total of 6 participants through friends and family networks who are currently or had gone through the workout or diet plan. Our participation was gender-balanced with 3 male and 3 female participants and the ages ranged from participants in their mid-20s to mid-30s. However, one of the major flaws of our study was that our participants were all Asian people, even though they are living in different countries which could influence their body perceptions. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We asked participants to share their self-posts on social media account or their favorite self pictures. We encouraged them to add annotations to tell us why they like them. Through those images, we tried to understand: How confidence they are toward their bodies? What their favorite parts of their bodies? What are the changes they want on their body? We also asked participants to tell or send us their daily clothes while checking the body shapes. It not only reinforces their body attitudes but helps us better understand their wearing clothes and the context of checking body shapes.                    
            </p>
            <h3>Part II</h3>
            <p>
                To make up the flaw that we didn’t recruit participants of various demographics, we decided to use secondary research and observation methods to enrich our data pool. As for secondary research, we checked out online articles and social media who talk about body anxiety. As for the observation, we went to North Campus Recreation Building and Central Campus Recreation Building two times, with each observation lasted for an hour. We intended to look at people’s behaviors throughout their workout, to find design opportunities and evaluate the possibility of the gym as a context for our design solution.
            </p>
        </div>
	  	<div>
            <h2>Interview</h2>
            <p>
                After the culture probe, we decided to focus on the audience who would like to keep motivated on their workout and diet way. We recruited a total of 4 participants all in their 20s for the interview session. 3 participants were female and 1 participant was male. Through the interview, our goals were to understand the goals for people to keep workout and diet, and their detailed behaviors and contexts of doing it (research questions 3-6).

	  <div id="ideation" class="main-section">
	  	<h1>Ideation Process</h1>
	  	<p>
	  		Based on our preliminary observations, our team conducted a brainstorm session where everyone in the team was given 20 minutes to write and sketch their ideas on the sticky notes. After this session, we went over the notes and sketches together, highlighted the recurring themes and features, and narrowed down the selected sketches to three main concepts.

      <div id="study_result" class="main-section">
        <h1>STUDY RESULTS</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                From the cultural probe, we summed up the key points and came out with key findings on participants’ aspects of changing their body shapes. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We gathered all the notes from interviews and put insightful ones on sticky notes. We then did a mini affinity wall to organize the notes for finding common themes and topics that are revealed from interviews.                    
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Cultural Probe</h2>
            <p>
                <h3>Key Finding 1: Our user group has more females than males, and more toward western culture than eastern culture.</h3>
                <p> 
                    Based on our research on social media, the tag of ‘#bodybuilding’ on Instagram has 98.1m posts, and the ‘#bodyshape’ tag on Instagram has 878k posts. Almost all of the posted images are sexy/muscle figure due to the results of their workout. Among those online posts, there are more female users than male users. There are more western users post pictures on their own body shapes than eastern users. 
                </p>
                <h3>Key finding 2: Body shape tracking during the changing process is a helpful approach to keep people motivated.</h3>
                <p>
                    All of our six participants on the cultural probe part I responded that they frequently check their body shapes with close-fitting clothes on purpose of tracking the changing process. The easy access to the information of individual body shape could bring people the motivation to keep working out and positive attitude to self-enrollment. One of the participants showed one of the posts she has on social media: ‘Every time I tend to give up on losing weight, I look at my body shape in the mirror and tell myself you are still far away from your goals on changing.’ And the other participant responded as: ‘ The happiest moment after the workout is not checking the number on the scale; instead it is to see the change in my body shape. ‘ While talking about the purpose of body shape tracking, one participant said ‘Take progress pics! This is my number one tip for staying motivated! Sometimes you won’t see the number on the scale move or you won’t be able to see the differences in your body right away because you see yourself in the mirror every day. But those progress pics won’t lie!’
                </p>
                <h3>Key finding 3: People track body shape for different purposes, and they would like to track different parts of their bodies.</h3>
                <p>
                    Due to our research, participants have diverse purposes on workout and track personal body shapes. Three of our participants track body shapes because of building muscles, two of the participants work out for losing weight, and the other one has the goal to keep a healthy lifestyle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, our participants pay attention to different parts of the body when they do the body shape tracking. Based on our cultural probe research parts I and II, the male participants are more willing to present their upper body as the fitness result; and females’ images are more diverse including front, back, side, legs, all with different postures. People’s goals and motivations for tracking also highly influence the decision making of which body parts to keep their attention.
                </p>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Interview</h2>
            <p>
                The first theme we found from interviews is that the reason why many people care and track their body shapes in the process of working out and changing diet is that weight doesn’t reflect the factors that they are interested about. One participant who works out six times a week for building better body shapes says that shapes are more important than weight because reduced weight doesn’t reflect that she is heading toward a correction direction for better body shape. Several other participants also suggest that weight is not an ideal measurement if they are more focusing on changing certain parts of their body rather than losing weight in general. Three out of four participants say that they are particularly concerned about if certain parts of their bodies have had significant changes. If no, two participants say, even the overall reduced weight would be not as satisfying.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even though all participants say that they care about their body shapes and check their bodies frequently, most of them don’t regularly track their body shapes using any type of tool. All participants check the changes of their body shapes by examining their bodies carefully, usually at gyms after working out or at home if mirrors are around. There are two main reasons why participants look carefully at their body shapes frequently; the first is that participants like to see that they are making some progress and seeing tiny changes could be encouraging and motivating for them to keep working out; the second is that participants are interested to know if their workout routine and new diet habits are effective for changing body shapes towards their goals. In that case, tools such as weight scale will not be informative if individuals’ focus is not on losing weight.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also found that, even though all participants check their body shapes, they experience many frustrations for getting information on their body attributes and on their progress with current tools and methods.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first pain point we found is that it is very hard to see the changes or progress of certain parts of individuals’ bodies such as the back. Two participants mentioned that, currently, they usually check their backs by turning their heads around in an awkward position or asking other people taking pictures of their backs. However, neither of these two is ideal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Second, unlike weight scale that provides quantitative data and allows individuals intuitively seeing their everyday progress, it is hard to see any visible body changes or to learn about the progress in a short period of time by looking at the mirror. One participant who is interested in getting more muscle says that it is easy and quick to see the progress if you are losing weight, but it takes up to three to six months for seeing real changes on body shapes if you are gaining muscles. Another participant who is interested in making her thighs thinner and hips higher says that she only feels that she is making real progress when her pants are getting loose, but she can’t be as certain about it as her changes in weight since there is no quantitative measurement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Third, it takes too much time and effort with currently available tools for tracking body changes. As we have seen in the TV Series The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Midge has the daily habit of measuring herself and take notes to track her changes in the notebook. While it could be a way of tracking body measurement, almost all our participants say that they wouldn’t spend too much time recording and inputting their body measurements. All participants also say that taking progress pictures for tracking progress also requires too much time and effort. Two female participants mention that they take pictures of themselves sometimes but don’t compare one to another in another period because too many pictures in the phones and it will presumably be time-consuming to put all the pictures side by side to see the changes. The method will not be as informative either because there is no information about the date when the pictures are taken and data of body measurements on those images. While the majority of our participants say that progress pictures might be nice, having to do all of the work manually takes too much time and they don’t think it is worth it to commit to doing so.
            </p>
            <p>
                One key insight we obtained from interviews with users is that there is a gap between users’ willingness and needs to accurately see and track the progress of their body shape changes and available tools for easily doing so. In order to bridge this gap, the challenge we have to tackle is how might we design for body shape tracking solution that allows users to assess their fitness routine, keeps them motivated and requires low effort.
            </p>
            <p>
                From talking to different participants, we also found that there are two types of user personas based on the different behavioral patterns we see from the interview data (See in appendix). Our primary persona is people who are body-shape-oriented when they workout. The whole point of working out for them is to reach a better body shape. For them, the little changes matter a lot for them to keep motivated, and seeing and tracking little progress is meaningful. Our secondary persona is people who workout for keeping a healthy and organized lifestyle. They care more about if the body is healthy and are interested in more holistic aspects of body attributes. Seeing changes in body shapes often is not their primary concern but it is nice and it helps them evaluating if the workout is effective.

          <h1>IDEATION AND SELECTION</h1>
          <p>
                After analyzing the results from our study and extracting several key findings above, we brainstormed a lot of ideas trying to solve the pain points and address the user’s needs and also refined the ideas we came up with during the milestone 1 based on the findings. In order to evaluate and select the “best three” ideas, we’ve developed several criteria to assess them:
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Private:</b> Personal information collected should be kept private and can only be accessible by the person using it.
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Accurate:</b> Data about body shape should be precise and accurate enough to see the difference between the before and after image even within the short term.
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Data Integrality:</b> Other health data collected such as weight, body fat rate, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Motivating:</b> Product should be motivating enough to help users stick on becoming healthier and change their body to the ideal shape
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Simple & easy to use:</b> The product should be easy to use such as simplifying the process of inputting the current data and retrieving history data.
          </p>
          <p>
              <b>Feasibility:</b> The technical constraints and feasibility should also be considered based on current technology.
          </p>

            <h2>Concept 1</h2>
            <p>
                The first idea is a smart scanner/mini projector that could be portable to set up on a mirror or other vertical spaces. After scanning/taking pictures, the device helps present the body shape outline on mirror/other vertical spaces. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It also automatically connects to the mobile application by Bluetooth. The app has the monitor screen linked to the big screen on the mirror/other vertical spaces.

            <p>
                The key features will be as following:

                The second idea is an installation in gyms, which consists of a unique QR code, a speaker, and a soft measuring wall.

            <ul>
                <li>

                <li>
                    The data will then be transmitted to user’s app and auto-compare with users’ previous body shape data. User is able to check the detailed information of a specific part as well.

                The third idea is a “smart suit” which can detect your body shape and transfer the data to your phone and reproduce and display an authentic image of your certain part of the body depending on your choice.
